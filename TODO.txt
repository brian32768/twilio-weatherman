Add alerts to the voice message

Consider the use of alternative weather services
like OpenWeatherMap to Weather Underground. Some of them
have geocoding built in.

Consider other geocoders

Make error handling more robust- in particular, reject latlon that NWS cannot process.
Changing to a different weather service might alleviate this problem.

Don't really need the voice status thing at all, remove it. (I turned it off at Twilio)
